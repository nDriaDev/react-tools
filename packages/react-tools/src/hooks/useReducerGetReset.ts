 * **`useReducerGetReset`**: Custom useReducer with get and reset state functions.
 * @param {R extends Reducer<any, any>} reducer - The reducer function that specifies how the state gets updated.
 * @param {ReducerState<R>} initialState - The value from which the initial state is calculated. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next _init_ argument.
 * @param {(init: ReducerState<R>) => ReducerState<R>} [initializer] - Function that should return the _initial state_. If itâ€™s not specified, the initial state is set to _initialState_, otherwise is set to the result of calling _initializer(initialState)_.
 * @returns {[ReducerState<R>, Dispatch<ReducerAction<R>>, ()=>ReducerState<R>, ()=>void]} array
